Python is becoming one of the scientific languages of choice, and many open-source tools are available for PV modeling. This tutorial will focus on teaching attendees PV modeling in python through the use of PVlib. \n",

This includes learning and simulating sun position, plane of array irradiances, temperature models, single-diode models and more. \n",

In case it's not obvious, a computer <b> is </b> required.  \n",
